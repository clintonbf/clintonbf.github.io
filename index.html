        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>
            I moved to Vancouver for work in Bioinformatics some years ago.
            I had a good mix of programming and biology in school and both disciplines interested me (and still do).
        </p>
        <p>After a few years in that field, global economics conspired to make bioinformatics a difficult career to pursue in Vancouver.
            I was reluctant to leave the life I had made here and so took a position at my martial arts school, and became one of the 20th century's first professional swordfighters (don't fact check that).
            Having done that for a few years I wanted a change, which is what has brought me to the CST program.
